## Overview

**WildfireData.jl** is a Julia package that provides unified access to multiple wildfire and fire-related geospatial datasets. It simplifies the process of downloading, querying, and working with fire data from U.S., Canadian, and global sources.

## Data Sources

The package includes modules for accessing data from:

| Module | Description | Data Type |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| [WFIGS](modules/wfigs.qmd) | Wildland Fire Interagency Geospatial Services | Current & historical fire perimeters |
| [IRWIN](modules/irwin.qmd) | Integrated Reporting of Wildland Fire Information | Fire incidents & perimeters |
| [FPA-FOD](modules/fpa-fod.qmd) | Fire Program Analysis Fire-Occurrence Database | Historical fire records (1992-2020) |
| [MTBS](modules/mtbs.qmd) | Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity | Burn severity & fire boundaries |
| [FIRMS](modules/firms.qmd) | Fire Information for Resource Management System | Satellite fire detections |
| [LANDFIRE](modules/landfire.qmd) | Landscape Fire and Resource Management | Fuel, vegetation, topography |
| [FEDS](modules/feds.qmd) | Fire Events Data Suite | Satellite-derived fire event tracking |
| [CWFIS](modules/cwfis.qmd) | Canadian Wildland Fire Information System | Canadian fire data & hotspots |
| [HMS](modules/hms.qmd) | NOAA Hazard Mapping System | Fire detections & smoke plumes |
| [GWIS](modules/gwis.qmd) | Global Wildfire Information System | Global fire danger & burnt areas |
| [EGP](modules/egp.qmd) | Enterprise Geospatial Portal | Operational & jurisdictional boundaries |

## Features

- **Unified API**: Consistent interface across different data sources
- **Multiple formats**: GeoJSON, CSV, SQLite, GeoTIFF support
- **Query capabilities**: Filter data by location, time, and attributes
- **Local caching**: Downloaded data is stored locally for reuse
- **Web services**: Access WCS/WMS endpoints for streaming data

## Quick Example

```julia
using WildfireData

# Get current fire perimeters
data = WFIGS.download(:current_perimeters, limit=10)

# Access features
for feature in data
    println(feature.IncidentName)
end
```

## Installation

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/RallypointOne/WildfireData.jl")
```
