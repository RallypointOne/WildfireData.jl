## Overview

The HMS module provides access to NOAA's Hazard Mapping System Fire and Smoke Product. HMS delivers daily satellite fire detection data and analyst-drawn smoke plume polygons produced by the NOAA/NESDIS Satellite Analysis Branch.

**Data Source:** [NOAA HMS Archive](https://satepsanone.nesdis.noaa.gov/pub/FIRE/web/HMS)

No API key is required.

## Available Products

| Product | Description | Format | Coverage |
|---------|-------------|--------|----------|
| `:fire_points` | Satellite-detected fire locations (MODIS, VIIRS, GOES, AVHRR) | CSV | 2003-present |
| `:smoke_polygons` | Analyst-drawn smoke plume polygons (light, medium, heavy) | Shapefile | 2005-present |

## Basic Usage

```julia
using WildfireData.HMS

# List available products
HMS.products()

# Print product info
HMS.info()
```

## Downloading Fire Points

Fire point data is returned as a `DataFrame` with columns: `Lon`, `Lat`, `YearDay`, `Time`, `Satellite`, `Method`, `Ecosystem`, `FRP`.

```julia
# Download fire detections for a specific date
df = HMS.download("2024-08-15")

# Using a Date object
using Dates
df = HMS.download(Date(2024, 8, 15))
```

## Downloading Smoke Polygons

Smoke polygon data is downloaded as a shapefile zip archive.

```julia
# Download smoke polygons for a date
path = HMS.download_smoke("2024-08-15")
```

## Building URLs

```julia
# Get the download URL for fire points
url = HMS.download_url(:fire_points, "2024-08-15")

# Get the download URL for smoke polygons
url = HMS.download_url(:smoke_polygons, "2024-08-15")
```

## Saving and Loading Fire Point Files

```julia
# Download and save fire points as CSV
path = HMS.download_file("2024-08-15")

# Load previously downloaded CSV
df = HMS.load_file("hms_fire20240815.csv")
```
