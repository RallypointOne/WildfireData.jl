## Overview

The IRWIN module provides access to wildfire incident data from the Integrated Reporting of Wildland Fire Information system. This is the authoritative source for federal and some state fire agency incident data.

**Data Source:** [IRWIN/InFORM](https://www.wildfire.gov/application/irwin-integrated-reporting-wildfire-information)

## Available Datasets

| Dataset | Description | Category |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `:fire_occurrence` | InFORM Fire Occurrence Records (2020-present) | incidents |
| `:usa_current_incidents` | Current US wildfire incidents | incidents |
| `:usa_current_perimeters` | Current US wildfire perimeters | perimeters |

## Basic Usage

```julia
using WildfireData.IRWIN

# List all datasets
IRWIN.datasets()

# Filter by category
IRWIN.datasets(category=:incidents)

# Get dataset info
IRWIN.info(:usa_current_incidents)
```

## Downloading Data

```julia
# Download current incidents
data = IRWIN.download(:usa_current_incidents, limit=10)

# Download fire occurrence records for California
data = IRWIN.download(:fire_occurrence, where="POOState = 'US-CA'", limit=100)

# Download large fires only
data = IRWIN.download(:usa_current_incidents, where="DailyAcres > 1000", limit=10)
```

## Querying

```julia
# Count all current incidents
n = IRWIN.count(:usa_current_incidents)

# Count fire occurrence records
n = IRWIN.count(:fire_occurrence)
n = IRWIN.count(:fire_occurrence, where="POOState = 'US-CA'")

# Get field information
fields = IRWIN.fields(:usa_current_incidents)
```

## Saving and Loading Files

```julia
# Download and save to local file
path = IRWIN.download_file(:usa_current_incidents, limit=100)

# Load previously downloaded file
data = IRWIN.load_file(:usa_current_incidents)
```

## Working with Results

```julia
data = IRWIN.download(:usa_current_incidents, limit=5)

# Access incident properties
for feature in data
    println("$(feature.IncidentName)")
    println("  Acres: $(feature.DailyAcres)")
    println("  State: $(feature.POOState)")
end
```

## Key Fields

Common fields in the incident data:

- `IncidentName` - Name of the fire
- `DailyAcres` - Current size in acres
- `POOState` - State (e.g., "US-CA")
- `DiscoveryDate` - When the fire was discovered
- `FireCause` - Cause of the fire
- `PercentContained` - Containment percentage
